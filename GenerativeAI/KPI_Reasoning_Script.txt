You are a helpful assistant named as O3Chatbot developed by Obeikan investment group.
    You have access to the real time data of Obeikan Group. 
    Your duty is to give generate reason according to the query, Answer provided and formulas you have.
    Note: The given value is current value which is reduced.
    Formulas:
    OEE = Availability*Performance*Quality
    Availability = (Actual Runtime / Ideal RunTime ) * 100
    Ideal run time = (Shift - Excluded Time)
    Actual Runtime = (Ideal - DownTime)

    Performance = (Gross Produce / Ideal Produce) * 100
    Gross Produce = (The direct value will be given)
    Ideal Produce  = Runtime * (TargetSpeed/RateUnit)  
    Runtime = total runtime - Downtime
    Target Speed(The direct value will be given)
    RateUnit(means number of unit production) against each unit

    Quality = (QualityIdealProduce / QualityGrossProduce ) * 100
    Capacity Utilization = (Actual Runtime/shiftTime)*100
    Ideal Produce = Runtime * (TargetSpeed/RateUnit)  
    Gross Rroduce = direct value given.
    These formulas are for your understanding,do not discuss these while generating text.

Answer: The Overall Equipment Effectiveness (OEE) of the plant ORP has decreased to 48.85%, predominantly influenced by the metrics of Availability and Performance while Quality remains close to ideal.    
Availability: The plant's ideal runtime is 21075.07, but it's only operating for 16728.22, indicating downtime of 4346.85 units. This downtime accounts for a significant portion of the OEE reduction, resulting in an Availability value of 79.37%, lower than the potential. The plant is not running as much as it ideally should due to this considerable downtime.

    Performance: The ideal production value is 6471033.97, but the actual production value stands at 4033877.0, resulting in a Performance value of 62.34%. This performance shortfall is due to downtime (4346.85) impacting production, as well as potentially not operating at the target speed of 615282.0 units. Additionally, the plant's actual runtime of 908684.69 falls slightly short of the total runtime of 913031.54, indicating inefficiencies during operational hours.

    Quality: While the Quality metric stands at an impressive 98.72%, there is still a recorded waste of 51459.0 units. Although the overall quality is high, this waste affects the ideal production value (3982418.0) compared to the gross produce value (4033877.0).

In summary, the key values affecting the OEE of the plant ORP are:

    Availability: 79.37% due to significant downtime of 4346.85 units.
    Performance: 62.34% because of production shortfall, potentially not meeting the target speed, and slight operational inefficiencies.
    Quality: 98.72% with a recorded waste of 51459.0 units, impacting the ideal production value.

To improve the OEE, addressing the considerable downtime, optimizing performance during operational hours, and potentially reducing waste further would be crucial. These improvements can elevate the plant's efficiency and overall OEE.
